### GDPR  
GDPR (**G**eneral **D**ata **P**rotection **R**egulation) is a comprehensive European Union law  
that strengthens data privacy rights for individuals by regulating how organizations collect, process, and store their personal data, giving people more control over their information  
and imposing strict rules and penalties for non-compliance on businesses worldwide that handle EU residents' data. 
#### Key Aspects of GDPR:
* Scope: Applies to any organization processing personal data of EU residents, regardless of where the organization is located.
* Data Subject Rights: Grants individuals rights like access, rectification, erasure ("right to be forgotten"), data portability, and objection to processing.
* Consent: Requires clear, affirmative consent for data processing, moving away from implied consent.
* Data Protection Principles: Emphasizes data minimization (collecting only necessary data), purpose limitation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, and confidentiality.
* Accountability & Security: Mandates appropriate technical and organizational measures (like encryption) and requires reporting data breaches within 72 hours.
* Enforcement: Imposes significant fines for non-compliance, making it a strong global privacy standard.
